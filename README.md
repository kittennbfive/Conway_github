# Conways Game of Life - on github user profile pages

**What??**  
Install this code as a Greasemonkey-Script, open a github user profile page like https://github.com/kittennbfive and look at the contribution calendar.

**Why??**  
I wanted to try. I might be the first one with this idea.

**This is useless**  
Yes, it is.

**The code is ugly**  
Maybe. My Javascript-skills are very limited.

**legal stuff**  
APGLv3+ and no warranty.

**other idea**  
Make a bot that pushes nonsense commits to a repository created for this (or even better meaningful commits to other repos) to draw a picture / a message on the contribution calendar.
